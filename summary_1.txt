### Salmonella ###

In July 2015 it was decided that detection of Salmonella in poultry was the most valuable business model and a demonstration of Salmonella detection on the QuickChip was needed as soon as possible prior to a September 2015 conference.  To attempt a demonstration on a short timeline, the commercially available Salmonella RPA kit from Twist Dx was tested for its performance.

The Twist Salmonella RPA kit was used to detect purified S. Typhimurium gDNA to determine the limit of detection on a real-time thermal cycler.  It was able to detect 1000 cp of gDNA per reaction but not as low as 100 copy per reaction.  Testing of different gDNA lots showed they performed similarly in RPA assays, with amplification coming off baseline at the same cycle number and saturating at the same cycle.  RPA reactions were successful in detecting gDNA after the complete workflow of pure liquid culture cell lysis and capture by silica beads, although there seemed to be some losses in overall yield of gDNA from the protocol.  When comparing the RPA reactions in microplate to those on QuickChip, the plate assays showed successful amplification, although signals were lower as the reagents have aged at the time of the experiment.  There was no detectable signal on the QuickChip for the RPA assays.  Opinions changed about RPA as the amplification chemistry for the QuickChip project and it was not pursued further.

As another amplification chemistry, the feasibility of developing NEAR assays was tested.  NEAR assays were designed targeting several different genes in Salmonella using bioinformatics approaches.  Attempting to use SYBR green for detection of the ssDNA products of the assay showed there was little/no difference between NTC and reactions containing 10,000 copies of gDNA as is typically observed with SYBR green detection of this chemistry.  Adjustments to polymerase concentrations to a slower/more ideal amplification speed still showed no difference between NTC and 10k copies.  Skewing of primer concentrations for several different assays again showed no differences by SYBR green detection with controls.  Use of non-optimized molecular beacons also showed no detectable fluorescence for the assays.  As a control for the input gDNA to all assays, qPCR assays were developed and used to compare lots purified Salmonella gDNA.  The different lots performed equivalently, indicated that failure of RPA reactions was likely caused by degradation of the RPA reagents over time, as observed for equivalent controls documented during development.  It cannot be determined using SYBR green whether NEAR reactions were successful without confirmation by a mass spectrometer.  

Opinions changed in mid-October 2015 about developing assays for Salmonella and the assay development, reagent optimization, and QuickChip testing was not pursued further.  

### Mastitis ###

In late October 2015, it was decided that detection of mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle was the most valuable business model.  It was determined that potential customers needed to be able to distinguish between live and dead pathogenic organisms in order to have a viable product, and that the development of a new technology for live vs. dead detection was high priority.  In order to overcome the limitations of developing NEAR assays without a mass spectrometer, I worked on developing a method for detection of small ssDNA products from reactions during assay development called product-linked qPCR (PL-qPCR).  The method relies on using the small ssDNA products as primers for qPCR, in order to link the successful amplification by NEAR to a detection by qPCR.  In addition, methods in the laboratory for the extraction and quantitation of DNA and RNA from the organisms of interest were established, in order to support efforts for live vs. dead distinction from pure cultures.  

Development of product-linked qPCR as a method began using synthetic oligonucleotides mimicking the expected products of an isothermal amplification assay and was successfully detected by qPCR by using the synthetic oligo as a primer for amplification in the reaction when paired.  The result indicates that qPCR can be used to detect DNA in a sequence-specific manner by linking its presence to qPCR with another downstream primer.   Some product oligos can be detected down to 10 nM concentration in the reactions and all were detected at 50 nM concentration, all making specific product in the qPCR by melt analysis.  Increasing the annealing temperature seemed to have varying effects on detection sensitivity, with some products being better amplified and most others being less well amplified.  Due to the potential for products to be of varying sizes it may be advantageous to have a lower annealing temperature to catch smaller product length oligos although this may decrease specificity.  A longer assay time was able to increase sensitvity, with all reactions containing 10 nM product oligo amplified successfully.  Detection of duplex products was successful and did not interfere with the specific primer used for detection in the qPCR.  Using a mixture of forward and reverse primers to detect a duplex DNA products was successful in qPCR amplification.  

Using mock NEAR assays after which specific product oligo was spiked in showed a very high level of amplification but little difference with reactions where synthetic product oligo was spiked in, likely caused by other products interfering with qPCR detection.  The qPCR amplification reactions start out at very high baseline, suggesting carry-over of a significant fraction of ssDNA from the isothermal reaction that is not intended.  SPRI beads were capable of purifying the oligonucleotide product, although the yield was quite low except when using the isopropanol-based 'Small RNA' protocol, which resulted in about 10-20% of the oligo.  Despite high baseline and presumabely non-specific amplification of carry-over products, there was a clear increase in amplification at cycles where SPRI purified product oligo came up from baseline.  This indicates that product oligo can be detected from within the non-specific carry over reaction products after SPRI cleanup.  To improve detection of products that have been spiked into isothermal amplification reactions and pulled down with SPRI beads, the incorporation of Uracil residues into the primers was used and did not seem to significantly change the outcome of the subsequent detection by qPCR.  Amplification still occurred and there were some slight differences between 10k cp and NTC for uracil-containing primers.  The addition of Uracil DNA Glycosylase eliminated amplification indicating the primers were destroyed.  The treatment of the samples with UDG appeared to significantly reduce the overall background in the downstream qPCR assays, however it was not specific for reactions containing Uracil-incorporated primers suggesting there is another mechanism by which the reduction in non-specific signal is happening.

# RNA isolation from S. aureus and RT-qPCR

Initial attempts at purifying RNA from S. aureus in the lab utilized the Qiagen RNA kit.  Using RT-qPCR as the method for quality/quantity measurement of the RNA isolation protocol, RNA samples amplified well, but 'no RT' controls show that there is significant DNA contamination in the RNA preps.  On-column DNaseI digestion did not eliminate or reduce gDNA contamination in the RNA preps.  Both the Direct Zol kit and Phenol:Chloroform extraction also did not eliminate gDNA contamination in RNA preps.  DNase digestion after Trizol extraction and Qiagen Kit also did not eliminate DNA contamination.  Increasing the amount of Trizol reagent relative to input cells and concentration of DNase in the digestion appeared to provide better reduction of gDNA contamination.  Initial RNA concentrations/yields in reactions was too low, the protocol was optimized with a greater number of cells.  Increasing the total amount of cells and also not vortexing Master Mix containing RT enzyme in RT-qPCR improved the detection and the data indicate it was successful in isolation and robust amplification of RNA.  Isolation of RNA and DNA fractions from the same cells was also successful.  Yields from purification were improved by incorporating Lysostaphin treatment, and it was shown that Proteinase K treatment did not significantly increase yields.

Several of the qPCR primer combinations were screened and determined to be suitable for detection with the MK.qPCR.285.F/359.R combination the best by amplification speed and intensity.  Ongoing quality control of the lab and personal gDNA lots showed that there was a clear difference in gDNA lots, as the older 7/17/15 lot performed ~10-fold lower in amplification than the newer 11/4/15 lot.  Additional optimizations included increasing the primer concentration to 1 uM each gave the highest signal and second highest amplification speed.  The assay performed nearly equivalently across the annealing tempeature range tested, with similar overall intensity and amplification speed.  There was very good reproducibility of within among RNA purifications, more variability among 'no RT' reactions, but this is likely non-specific amplification taking over.  Based on nuc gene mRNA targeted primers, the RNA lots are unstable in long-term -20C storage, since there was no amplification with RNA after a week but gDNA controls worked well.  Development of multiple 16S RNA assays as an alternative showed good amplification down to 1000 copies gDNA, with several also detecting 100 copies easily.  The pre-rRNA targeted primers performed well and showed no non-specific amplification in NTCs.  

Once a reliable method for DNA and RNA extractions was optimized and qPCR assays developed an approach was needed to detect whether the purified nucleic acids were indicative of live or dead cells status.  PMA crosslinking was used as a commercially available method for validating the approach with pure S. aureus cultures.  PMA crosslinking did not significantly effect amplification of RNA from live cells, but appeared to reduce amplification of the nuc mRNA from dead cells that had been heat treated.  PMA crosslinking had a noticeable effect on gDNA amplification in live vs. dead cells.  There was a slight decrease in gDNA from live cells after PMA crosslinking that may have been due to stable gDNA from dead cells in non-heat treated (live) cultures that carried through.  By standardizing the amount of input DNA in the sample, more quantitative comparison among treatments could be made.  The PMA crosslinking was effective in reducing amplification of the dead cells but had relatively small effects on the live cells by comparison.  The PMA crosslinking appears to reduce amplification of dead cell RNA specifically without any effect on live cell RNA.  The non-PMA treated dead cell RNA was still intact, suggesting it is not unstable throughout the extraction and crosslinking process.   In an alternative protocol, heat treatment and "holding" at 37C for 1 hour afterwards did not significantly destabilize the RNA prior to extraction.  Dead cells showed a PMA-dependent lag in amplification when normalized for input DNA concentration.  The live, +PMA cells showed no amplification at all, but without PMA amplified normally, suggesting there was something about the PMA crosslinking after the 37C-1 hour hold that was detremental to the sample.  Nuclease treatment of extracts showed that the DNA was not significantly impacted RNA can be destabilized in a rapid fashion for both live and dead cells and may have a larger impact if optimized specifically for the dead cells in a sample.  

# S. aureus nuclease activity assay

S. aureus secretes a thermostable nuclease that is commonly used in a plate-based assay for detection of S. aureus isolates in samples.  A more rapid, fluorescence-based molecular test was developed as an alternative.  S. aureus thermostable nuclease activity was detected in samples after heat treatment using the increase in fluorescence of the molecular beacon after its degradation.  Determination of thermonuclease activity limit of detection at early timepoints was complicated by carryover from overnight culture being diluted into outgrowth culture.  An experiment was designed to start with very dilute levels of washed S. aureus cells and correlate colony counts at timepoints with thermonuclease activity measured by fluorescence.  The limit of detection for the assay is around 10^7 cfu/ml based on correlating plating results with nuclease activity from the sample
	
# Multiple Oligonucleotide Cascade Amplification (MOCA)

New technologies for the rapid detection of small amounts of nucleic acids have a broad range of important applications.  I developed a new assay that utilized the release of sequestered oligonucleotides upon introduction of a target nucleic acid that allows for the rapid amplification of the signal by utilizing those release oligonucleotides as primers for subsequent annealing, polymerase-driven extension, and release of even more oligonucleotides.  The released oligonucleotides can then be detected with a variety of methods, initially designed for use with molecular beacons.  As a proof-of-principle of individual steps of the reaction pathway, a synthetic set of DNA substates was designed and tested to determine optimum polymerase and oligonucleotide concentrations, and several design features of the oligonucleotides that would make them more suitable for MOCA.  It was found that 12U Bst Polymerase was suitable for activity measurement over the 45 min timecourse, and 100 nM of FAM labeled oligo and at least 80 nM Quencher oligo were sufficient for assay measurements.  The addition of excess sequestration oligo does not prevent the synthetic primer from "switching" strands to hybridize and extend on the labeled substrate, but does slow it down and prevent it reaching full fluorescence by extension, this may be due to an equillibrium being reached between accessible primer for extension versus that which is hybridized to sequestration oligo.  Addition of a trigger oligo that can extend from the sequestration oligo to displace the primer increased endpoint fluorescence, presumably by allowing for more primer to be displaced from the sequestration oligo and disrupt hybridization equilibrium, a key confirmation of the MOCA reaction process.	Introducing mismatches into the trigger oligo reduced that effect until a large nubmer of mismatches eliminated it, perhaps preventing extension from the trigger oligo and creating a situation where equillibrium between sequestration oligo and primer was the main driver.  There was no signal in reactions lacking primer indicating that sequestration oligo or its triggers are not sufficient for separating the FAM/BHQ oligo substrate.  Mismatch oligos with 5' mismatches still allow for some detectable polymerase extension.  Single mismatch oligos at the 3'end were sufficient to eliminate measurable activity.

# LAMP on QuickChip

LAMP assays developed by Kelly Anklam at UW were tested on the QuickChip.  There appeared to be little or no amplificaiton of the LAMP assays on the chip, with both negative and positive controls showing equivalent background	levels.  The lack of amplification on chip may be due to the long dry time necessary for a 2 ul reaction volume (about 60 minutes dry time).  The assays showed a fluorescence signal in the real-time thermal cycler, although there was not enough Master Mix volume to perform necessary controls lacking genomic DNA to determine if amplification signal was specific to the target DNA or not.
