### Salmonella ###

In July 2015 it was decided that detection of Salmonella in poultry was the most valuable business model and a demonstration of Salmonella detection on the QuickChip was needed as soon as possible prior to a September 2015 conference.  To attempt a demonstration on a short timeline, the commercially available Salmonella RPA kit from Twist Dx was tested for its performance.

The Twist Salmonella RPA kit was used to detect purified S. Typhimurium gDNA to determine the limit of detection on a real-time thermal cycler.  It was able to detect 1000 cp of gDNA per reaction but not as low as 100 copy per reaction.  Testing of different gDNA lots showed they performed similarly in RPA assays, with amplification coming off baseline at the same cycle number and saturating at the same cycle.  RPA reactions were successful in detecting gDNA after the complete workflow of pure liquid culture cell lysis and capture by silica beads, although there seemed to be some losses in overall yield of gDNA from the protocol.  When comparing the RPA reactions in microplate to those on QuickChip, the plate assays showed successful amplification, although signals were lower as the reagents have aged at the time of the experiment.  There was no detectable signal on the QuickChip for the RPA assays.  Opinions changed about RPA as the amplification chemistry for the QuickChip project and it was not pursued further.

As another amplification chemistry, the feasibility of developing NEAR assays was tested.  NEAR assays were designed targeting several different genes in Salmonella using bioinformatics approaches.  Attempting to use SYBR green for detection of the ssDNA products of the assay showed there was little/no difference between NTC and reactions containing 10,000 copies of gDNA.  Adjustments to polymerase concentrations to a slower/more ideal amplification speed still showed no difference between NTC and 10k copies.  Skewing of primer concentrations for several different assays again showed no differences by SYBR green detection with controls.  Use of non-optimized molecular beacons also showed no detectable fluorescence for the assays.  As a controls for the input gDNA to all assays, qPCR assays were developed and used to compare lots purified Salmonella gDNA.  The different lots performed equivalently, indicated that failure of RPA reactions was likely caused by degradation of the RPA reagents over time, as observed for equivalent controls documented during development.  It cannot be determined using SYBR green whether NEAR reactions were successful without confirmation by a mass spectrometer.  

Opinions changed in mid-October 2015 about developing assays for Salmonella and the assay development, reagent optimization, and QuickChip testing was not pursued further.  

### Mastitis ###

In late October 2015, it was decided that detection of mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle was the most valuable business model.  It was determined that potential customers needed to be able to distinguish between live and dead pathogenic organisms in order to have a viable product, and that the development of a new technology for live vs. dead detection was the top priority.  In order to overcome the limitations of developing NEAR assays without a mass spectrometer, I worked on developing a method for detection of small ssDNA products from reactions during assay development called product-linked qPCR (PL-qPCR).  The method relies on using the small ssDNA products as primers for qPCR, in order to link the successful amplification by NEAR to a detection by qPCR.  In addition, methods in the laboratory for the extraction and quantitation of DNA and RNA from the organisms of interest were established, in order to support efforts for live vs. dead distinction from pure cultures.  

Development of product-linked qPCR as a method began using synthetic oligonucleotides mimicking the expected products of an isothermal amplification assay and was successfully detected by qPCR by using the synthetic oligo as a primer for amplification in the reaction when paired.  The result indicates that qPCR can be used to detect DNA in a sequence-specific manner by linking its presence to qPCR with another downstream primer.   Some product oligos can be detected down to 10 nM concentration in the reactions and all were detected at 50 nM concentration, all making specific product in the qPCR by melt analysis.  Increasing the annealing temperature seemed to have varying effects on detection sensitivity, with some products being better amplified and most others being less well amplified.  Due to the potential for products to be of varying sizes it may be advantageous to have a lower annealing temperature to catch smaller product length oligos although this may decrease specificity.  A longer assay time was able to increase sensitvity, with all reactions containing 10 nM product oligo amplified successfully.  Detection of duplex products was tested, is robust, and did not interfere with the specific primer used for detection in the qPCR.  Using a mixture of forward and reverse primers to detect a duplex DNA products was successful in qPCR amplification.  

Using mock NEAR assays after which specific product oligo was spiked in showed a very high level of amplification but little difference with reactions where synthetic product oligo was spiked in, likely that other products are interfering with qPCR detection.  The qPCR amplification reactions are start out at very high baseline, suggesting that carry-over of a significant fraction of ssDNA from the isothermal reaction that is not intended.	SPRI beads were capable of purifying the oligonucleotide product, although the yield was quite low except when using the isopropanol-based 'Small RNA' protocol, which resulted in about 10-20% of the oligo.  Despite high baseline and presumabely non-specific amplification of carry-over products, there was a clear increase in amplification at cycles where SPRI purified product oligo came up from baseline.  This indicates that product oligo can be detected from within the non-specific carry over reaction products after SPRI cleanup.  To improve detection of products after pulldown with SPRI beads after they have been spiked into isothermal amplification reactions, the incorporation of Uracil residues into the primers did not seem to significantly change the outcome of the subsequent detection by qPCR.  Amplification still occurred and there were some slight differences between 10k cp and NTC for uracil-containing primers, the addition of UDG eliminated amplification indicating the primers were destroyed.  The treatment of the samples with UDG appeared to significantly reduce the overall background in the downstream qPCR assays, however it was not specific for reactions containing Uracil-incorporated primers suggesting there is another mechanism by which the reduction in non-specific signal is happening.

# qPCR of RNA

Although a milk optimized lysis buffer was used in the lab that resulted in complete clearing of target organisms such as S. aureus and E. coli on plates when examining bacterial growth at the concentrations greater than 10^5 cfu/ml, the resulting capture of released nucleic acids was complicated by lack of an efficient capture method.  Therefore, initial attempts at purifying RNA from S. aureus in the lab utilized the Qiagen RNA kit.  Using RT-qPCR as the method for quality/quantity measurement of the RNA isolation protocol, RNA samples amplified well, but 'no RT' controls show that there is significant DNA contamination in the RNA preps.  On-column DNaseI digestion did not eliminate or reduce gDNA contamination in the RNA preps.  Both the Direct Zol kit and Phenol:Chloroform extraction also did not eliminate gDNA contamination in RNA preps.  DNase digestion after Trizol extraction and Qiagen Kit also did not eliminate DNA contamination.  Increasing the amount of Trizol reagent relative to input cells and concentration of DNase in the digestion appeared to provide better reduction of gDNA contamination.  Initial RNA concentrations/yields in reactions was too low, the protocol was optimized with a greater number of cells.  Increasing the total amount of cells and also not vortexing Master Mix containing RT enzyme in RT-qPCR were the differences in this experiment, and the data indicate it was successful in isolation and robust amplification of RNA.  Isolation of RNA and DNA fractions from the same cells was also successful.  Yields from purification were improved by incorporating Lysostaphin treatment, and it was shown that Proteinase K treatment did not significantly increase yields.

Several of the qPCR primer combinations were screened and determined to be suitable for detection with the MK.qPCR.285.F/359.R combination the best by amplification speed and intensity.  Ongoing quality control of the lab and personal gDNA lots showed that there was a clear difference in gDNA lots, as the older 7/17/15 lot performed ~10-fold lower in amplification than the newer 11/4/15 lot.  Additional optimizations included increasing the primer concentration to 1000 nM each gave the highest signal and second highest amplification speed.  The assay performed nearly equivalently across the annealing tempeature range tested, with similar overall intensity and amplification speed.  There was very good reproducibility of within among RNA purifications, more variability among 'no RT' reactions, but this is likely non-specific amplification taking over.  Based on nuc gene mRNA targeted primers, the RNA lots are unstable in long-term -20C storage, since there was no amplification with RNA after a week but gDNA controls worked well.  Development of multiple 16S RNA assays as an alternative showed good amplification down to 1000 cp gDNA, with several also detecting 100 cp easily.  The pre-rRNA targeted primers performed well and showed no non-specific amplification in NTCs.  

Once a validation method for DNA and RNA extractions were optimized and qPCR assays developed an approach was needed to detect whether the purified nucleic acids were indicative of live or dead cells status.  PMA crosslinking was used as a commercially available method for validating the approach with pure S. aureus cultures.  PMA crosslinking did not significantly effect RNA amplification in live cells, but appeared to reduce amplification of the nuc mRNA from dead cells that had been heat treated.  PMA crosslinking had a noticeable effect on gDNA amplification in live vs. dead cells.  There was a slight decrease in gDNA from live cells after PMA crosslinking that may  have been due to stable gDNA from dead cells in non-heat treated (live) cultures that carried through.  By standardizing the amount of input DNA in the sample allowed for a more quantitative comparison among treatments.  The PMA crosslinking was effective in reducing amplification of the dead cells but had relatively small effects on the live cells by comparison.  The PMA crosslinking appears to reduce amplification of dead cell RNA specifically without any effect on live cell RNA.  The non-PMA treated dead cell RNA was still intact, suggesting it is not unstable throughout the extraction and crosslinking process.  There was no distinction between live and dead cell RNA amplification, indicated that heat treatment and "holding" at 37C for 1 hour afterwards did not significantly destabilize the RNA.  There was an unexpected lack of amplification of -PMA samples, which is not due to the sample heating or extraction, but may be an artifact of treatment and crosslinking protocol.  Dead cells showed a PMA-dependent lag in amplification when normalized for input DNA concentration.  The Live, +PMA cells showed no amplification at all, but without PMA amplified normally, suggesting there was something about the PMA crosslinking after the 37C 1 hour hold that was detremental to the sample.  Nuclease treatment of extracts showed that the DNA was not significantly impacted but
it destabilized RNA in a rapid fashion for both live and dead cells and may have a larger impact if optimized specifically for dead cells in a sample.

# S. aureus nuclease activity assay

S. aureus secretes a thermostable nuclease that is commonly used in a plate-based assay for detectinon of S. aureus isolates in samples.  A more rapid, fluorescence-based molecular test was developed as an alternative.  S. aureus thermostable nuclease activity was detected in samples after heat treatment using the increase in fluorescence of the molecular beacon after its degradation.  Determination of thermonuclease activity limit of detection at early timepoints was complicated by carryover from overnight culture being diluted into outgrowth culture.  An experiment was designed to start with very dilute levels of washed S. aureus cells and correlate colony counts at timepoints with thermonuclease activity measured by fluorescence.  The limit of detection for the assay is around 10^7 cfu/ml based on correlating plating results with nuclease activity from the sample
	
# Multiple Oligonucleotide Cascade Amplification (MOCA)

New technologies for the rapid detection of small amounts of nucleic acids have a broad range of important applications.  I developed a new assay that utilized the release of sequestered oligonucleotides upon introduction of a target nucleic acid that allows for the rapid amplification of the signal for detection.  

> A 10:000 dilution of NEB Bst Polymerase at 120U/ul was suitable for activity measurement over the 45 min timecourse
> 100 nM of FAM labeled oligo and at least 80 nM Quencher oligo were sufficient for assay measurements
> Addition of excess F2 oligo does not prevent R1.Primer.1 from "switching" strands to extend on the FAM/BHQ substrate, but does slow it down and prevent it reaching full fluorescence	
	This may be due to an equillibrium being reached between accessible R1.Primer.1 for extension vs that which is hybridized to F2
> Addition of a trigger oligo R2.Primer.1 increased endpoint fluorescence, presumably by allowing for more R1.Primer.1 to be displaced from F2 to disrupt hyb equillibrium	
> Introducing mismatches into the trigger oligoss R2.Primer.2-4 reduced that effect until a large nubmer of mismatches eliminated it, perhaps preventing extension from the trigger oligo and creating a'	
	situation where equillibrium between F2 and R1.Primer.1  was the main driver, similar to Reaction #4
> There was no signal in reactions lacking R1.Primer.1 indicated that F2 or its triggers are not sufficient for separating the FAM/BHQ oligo substrate	

> ALl mismatch oligos eliminated polymerase extension to a significant extent
> Mismatch oligo R1.6 appeared to give a very slight amount of activity, suggesting that 5' mismatches still allow for some polymerase extension possibly
> Single mismatch oligos at the 3'end were sufficient to eliminate measurable acitivty
> There was very low activity in the assay, possible causes include no DTT in reaction buffer, vortexing of polymerase

# LAMP on Chip
> There appeared to be little or no amplificaiton of the LAMP assays on the chip, with both negative and positive controls showing equivalent background	
	fluorescence to the assay-containing wells
> The lack of amplification on chip may be due to the long dry time necessary for the 2 ul reaction volume (60 minutes)	
> The assays showed a fluorescence signal in the real-time thermal cycler, although there was not enough Master Mix volume to perform necessary controls	
	lacking genomic DNA to determine if amplification signal was specific to the target DNA
