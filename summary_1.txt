### Salmonella ###

In July 2015 it was decided that detection of Salmonella in poultry was the most valuable business model and a demonstration of Salmonella detection on the QuickChip was needed as soon as possible prior to a September 2015 conference.  To attempt a demonstration on a short timeline, the commercially available Salmonella RPA kit from Twist Dx was tested for its performance.

The Twist Salmonella RPA kit was used to detect purified S. Typhimurium gDNA to determine the limit of detection on a real-time thermal cycler.  It was able to detect 1000 cp of gDNA per reaction but not as low as 100 copy per reaction.  Testing of different gDNA lots showed they performed similarly in RPA assays, with amplification coming off baseline at the same cycle number and saturating at the same cycle.  RPA reactions were successful in detecting gDNA after the complete workflow of pure liquid culture cell lysis and capture by silica beads, although there seemed to be some losses in overall yield of gDNA from the protocol.  When comparing the RPA reactions in microplate to those on QuickChip, the plate assays showed successful amplification, although signals were lower as the reagents have aged at the time of the experiment.  There was no detectable signal on the QuickChip for the RPA assays.  Opinions changed about RPA as the amplification chemistry for the QuickChip project and it was not pursued further.

As another amplification chemistry, the feasibility of developing NEAR assays was tested.  NEAR assays were designed targeting several different genes in Salmonella using bioinformatics approaches.  Attempting to use SYBR green for detection of the ssDNA products of the assay showed there was little/no difference between NTC and reactions containing 10,000 copies of gDNA.  Adjustments to polymerase concentrations to a slower/more ideal amplification speed still showed no difference between NTC and 10k copies.  Skewing of primer concentrations for several different assays again showed no differences by SYBR green detection with controls.  Use of non-optimized molecular beacons also showed no detectable fluorescence for the assays.  As a controls for the input gDNA to all assays, qPCR assays were developed and used to compare lots purified Salmonella gDNA.  The different lots performed equivalently, indicated that failure of RPA reactions was likely caused by degradation of the RPA reagents over time, as observed for equivalent controls documented during development.  It cannot be determined using SYBR green whether NEAR reactions were successful without confirmation by a mass spectrometer.  

Opinions changed in mid-October 2015 about developing assays for Salmonella and the assay development, reagent optimization, and QuickChip testing was not pursued further.  

### Mastitis ###

In late October 2015, it was decided that detection of mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle was again the most valuable business model.  It was determined that potential customers needed to be able to distinguish between live and dead pathogen organisms in order to have a viable product, and that the development of a new technology for live vs. dead detection was the top priority.  In order to overcome the limitations of developing NEAR assays without a mass spectrometer, I worked on developing a method for detection of small ssDNA products from reactions during assay development called product-linked qPCR (PL-qPCR).  The method relies on using the small ssDNA products as primers for qPCR, in order to link the successful amplification by NEAR to a detection by qPCR.  In addition, methods in the laboratory for the extraction and quantitation of DNA and RNA from the organisms of interest were established, in order to support efforts for live vs. dead distinction from pure cultures.  

# PL-qPCR


> Synthetic oligonucleotides mimicking the expected products of an isothermal amplification assay were successfully detected by qPCR by using the synthetic oligo as a primer for amplification in the reaction	
	when paired with another downstream primer
> The result indicates that qPCR can be used to detect DNA in a sequence-specific manner by linking its presence to qPCR	
> Some product oligos can be detected down to 10 nM concentration in the reactions and all were detected at 50 nM concentration, all making specific product in the qPCR by melt analysis
	
> Increasing the annealing temperature seemed to have varying effects on detection sensitivity, with some products being better amplified and most others being less well amplified
> Due to the potential for products to be of varying sizes it may be advantageous to have a lower annealing temperature to catch smaller product length oligos although this may decrease specificity
	
> The longer assay time was able to increase sensitvity, with all reactions containing 10 nM product oligo amplified successfully
> Isothermal amplification using the indicated assays was successful, there was no apparent difference between NTC and 10k cp gDNA reactions suggesting there may be little specific product generated
> Note: primer 1's used too narrowly, redesign experiment so both NTC and +Target reactions are tested with both Fwd and Rev qPCR primers
> Very high level of amplification in these reactions but little differece with reactions where synthetic product oligo was spiked in, likely that other products are interfering with qPCR detection
> The qPCR amplification reaction are starting out at very high baseline, suggesting that is carry-over of a significant fraction of ssDNA from the isothermal reaciton that is not intended	
> Detection of duplex products was still robust and did not interfere with the specific primer used for detection in the qPCR
> Using a mixture of forward and reverse primers to detect a duplex DNA products was successful in qPCR amplification
> Several of the qPCR primer combinations are suitable for further development with the 285.F/359.R combination the best by amplification speed and intensity
> The gDNA may be too old and performance suffering
> There was a clear difference in gDNA lots, as the older 7/17 lot performed ~10-fold lower in amplification than the newer 11/4 lot
> Increasing the primer concentration to 1000 nM each gave the highest signal and second highest amplification speed
> The assay performed nearly equivalently across the annealing tempeature range tested, with similar overall intensity and amplification speed
> SPRI beads were capable of purifying the oligonucleotide, although the yield was quite low except when using the isopropanol-based 'Small RNA' protocol, which resulted in nearly full recovery of the oligo

> Recovery of oligo products from beads still around 10%
> Despite high baseline and presumabely non-specific amplification of carry-over products, there was a clear increase in amplification at cycles where purified product oligo came up from baseline
> This indicates that product oligo can be detected from within the non-specific carry over reaction products

qPCR of RNA
> RNA samples amplified well, but 'no RT' controls show that there is significant DNA contamination in the RNA preps
> On-column DNaseI digestion did not eliminate or reduce gDNA contamination in RNA preps
> The Direct Zol kit and Phenol:Chloroform extraction did not eliminate gDNA contamination in RNA preps
> DNase digestion after Trizol extraction and Qiagen Kit did not eliminate DNA contamination

Plating of Sa in milk after lysis
> Lysis buffer was sufficient for complete clearing of plates examining bacterial growth even at the highest concentration tested where the bacteria	
	would be predicted to form a lawn
